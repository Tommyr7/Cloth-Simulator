# Cloth Simulator

### Introduction

- Our project is a cloth simulator that conforms to the geometric and dynamic detail of the simulated cloth. The project is available for several kinds of materials.
- Team Members:
  - Yaoxu Song
  - Zhen Huang
  - Weihao Zhu

### Problem Description

- Cloth simulation has been a major topic of computer graphics research for recent years. With extremely complicated textures, cloth simultaneously exhibits both highly detailed wrinkles and folds, and float or smoothly curving regions in real life. High-quality simulation requires enormous computation and memory costs. From previous papers, we plan to learn how to accomplish the simulation, based on which we try to simulate several kinds of materials on our own.

### Goals & Deliverables

- We are trying to accomplish a cloth simulator, and also accomplish several kinds of different cloth materials by ourselves.
- We will render some images using our cloth simulator with different cloth textures.
- The performance of our cloth simulator is based on whether our cloth textures are close to reality.
- What we plan to deliver: accomplish the cloth simulator successfully. What we hope to deliver: design cloth textures close to reality on our own.

### Schedule

- Week 1: read relevant papers
- Week 2~4: accomplish the cloth simulator
- Week 5: design cloth textures
- Week 5~6: render images, write paper, present videos, prepare presentation
